          <h3>Beginnings with Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            I became interested in web development in 2004, when I created a
            portfolio website as part of a class assignment in my doctoral
            program in Spanish. At that time, I had no knowledge of coding
            whatsoever. In fact, I utilized Dreamweaver's graphical user
            interface to complete the project without writing a single line of
            code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following year, I volunteered to create the website for the
            department's annual graduate student symposium, and the year after
            that I became the webmaster for the Department of Spanish and
            Portuguese. During the three years that I served in this capacity, I
            taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, a server-side language called
            CFML, or ColdFusion, and the database language SQL.
          </p>
          <h3>Switching Careers and Becoming Politically Active</h3>
          <p>
            In 2016, after having taught college-level Spanish for over ten
            years, I decided to return to web development with the goal of
            making it a career. To reach this objective, I began by completing
            Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Next, in 2018, I
            completed Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree after earning
            a full scholarship through the Grow With Google Initiative. During
            the program I won the student story competition and earned another
            scholarship to the React Nanodegree program, which I completed in
            June of 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time that I was completing my career change, I was
            becoming aware of the need to become politically active. In 2016, I
            became a part of the movement that sprang up around the presidential
            candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders, volunteering to make phone
            calls to voters and engaging with fellow campaign volunteers. After
            the election, I remained politically active, volunteering for
            organizations such as Justice Democrats. More recently, I
            volunteered for Sanders' 2020 bid as both a web developer and a
            Spanish call team volunteer.
          </p>
          <h3>
            The Path Forward: Fusing Web Development with Political Activism
          </h3>
          <p>
            The ideas behind Senator Sanders' leftist platform are supported by
            the majority of the country, and the democratic party has begun to
            adopt them. I plan to continue contributing to tech projects that
            help to make this platform a reality in the coming years. In the
            uncertain and perilous times in which we live, it is incumbent upon
            each of us to become as involved as we can in the political process.
            As a web developer in service of this progressive vision, I hope to
            play a part in making the country and world a more just, healthy,
            and equitable place.
